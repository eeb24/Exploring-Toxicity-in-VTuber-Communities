Hololive,n66jkuk,"I agree with you but you didn't mention the reason why it's different. :P So I'll just write it down, why I think so, because there may be some people who genuinely don't see a difference.   Photography-   A photo is of a place and time, occurring only once. To have the presence of mind to capture it, to frame it correctly, to tell a story with a picture, there's a talent to it. There's also technical aspects like getting the lighting correct, understanding how the camera works. Because of these aspects, some people will become impressed by a well done photograph.  The difference between an artist and someone who is not an artist, IMO is the combination of effort and thought. There's no art in a typical piece of concrete, though someone may be impressed and see art in a particularly well made piece of concrete. When you become impressed by the effort and thought in things, that's when that thing becomes ""art"".  When someone types a prompt, they're not the one doing the effort, and the thought is minimal. The effort and thought lies with the people who created the AI and the data set that it's trained off of. No one will be impressed with someone who typed a prompt. That's not to say there won't eventually be something to ""prompting"", I just don't see how anyone will be impressed with what they're doing now.",1,1753975898.0,t1_n6651x3,t3_1me0icx,i agree with you but you didnt mention the reason why its different p so ill just write it down why i think so because there may be some people who genuinely dont see a difference photography a photo is of a place and time occurring only once to have the presence of mind to capture it to frame it correctly to tell a story with a picture theres a talent to it theres also technical aspects like getting the lighting correct understanding how the camera works because of these aspects some people will become impressed by a well done photograph the difference between an artist and someone who is not an artist imo is the combination of effort and thought theres no art in a typical piece of concrete though someone may be impressed and see art in a particularly well made piece of concrete when you become impressed by the effort and thought in things thats when that thing becomes art when someone types a prompt theyre not the one doing the effort and the thought is minimal the effort and thought lies with the people who created the ai and the data set that its trained off of no one will be impressed with someone who typed a prompt thats not to say there wont eventually be something to prompting i just dont see how anyone will be impressed with what theyre doing now,0.038991302,0.0018405914,0.018581128,0.023652986,0.008129764,0.00673361,0.1965881,0.014154521,0.9734

Hololive,n63e4pa,"Her model's silhouette in general is very crisp and readable which helps a lot to emphasize movement when dancing, compared to others like, say, Laplus who can't really do choreography that points her back to the camera because her hair almost entirely obscures her.  The puffy sleeves emphasize her arm movements well but it detracts from certain movements that focus on her hands and wrists so it'll depend on the dance.   A prime example is during her solo performance in 6th Fes, where she utilized her non-puffed arms to do some sick wrist moves: [Example 1,](https://youtu.be/4C3kreEOk1Q?t=2744) [Example 2](https://youtu.be/4C3kreEOk1Q?t=2770). Similarly wrist-focused movement isn't as pronounced with the sleeves, like in [this part of the BANG!! performance](https://youtu.be/viPlIHvk724?t=2517) from her Kagura 3D live with the flowy wave movement of her hands being mostly drowned out by the larger silhouette of the sleeves. However, the sleeves do really well when her entire arms are involved in the movement ([like this example](https://youtu.be/viPlIHvk724?t=2590)) because it's 2 different colors, blue and yellow contrasting with her torso's white, so it's great visual clarity.  Of course all this is subjective and that was my opinion on her model's design in relation to dancing. As an artist/animator, silhouettes are really important for clarity and impact and IMO Bae's default outfit is great for this. If there's anything i'd change, i'd put her black glove on the other hand so that it contrasts with the yellow instead of the blue because her skin tone blends almost seamlessly with the sleeve.",2,1753928280.0,t3_1mde3kg,t3_1mde3kg,her models silhouette in general is very crisp and readable which helps a lot to emphasize movement when dancing compared to others like say laplus who cant really do choreography that points her back to the camera because her hair almost entirely obscures her the puffy sleeves emphasize her arm movements well but it detracts from certain movements that focus on her hands and wrists so itll depend on the dance a prime example is during her solo performance in th fes where she utilized her nonpuffed arms to do some sick wrist moves example example similarly wristfocused movement isnt as pronounced with the sleeves like in this part of the bang performance from her kagura d live with the flowy wave movement of her hands being mostly drowned out by the larger silhouette of the sleeves however the sleeves do really well when her entire arms are involved in the movement like this example because its different colors blue and yellow contrasting with her torsos white so its great visual clarity of course all this is subjective and that was my opinion on her models design in relation to dancing as an artistanimator silhouettes are really important for clarity and impact and imo baes default outfit is great for this if theres anything id change id put her black glove on the other hand so that it contrasts with the yellow instead of the blue because her skin tone blends almost seamlessly with the sleeve,0.08320791,0.0037956238,0.027730936,0.046922635,0.008867673,0.012943448,0.3798163,0.06447382,0.9857

A sum up of what this is, based on the linked article from what I gather. Through some completely unknown tech and arbitrary surveillance of your account (red flag) they'll gauge if your account is a teen or an adult (red flag). Then forcefully apply restrictions against your will (full sail red).  Off the bat, what the helly?  But if you're an adult and you ""mistakenly"" get marked then you have to ID yourself to them to take it off. Now your real identity is registered to Google. They know who you are, they know which account is yours, and they can monitor your activity knowing it's you. The anonymity of the internet no longer applies. They're gathering information on you and all of us.  And among the teen account restrictions in that list is this little gem:  * Minimizing recommendations of videos with content that could be problematic if viewed in repetition  Google/Youtube will try to restrict what you can or can't watch at their discretion. They worded it very vaguely too so they can be at liberty to block whatever they want. What defines as ""problematic""?  Governments and corporations do this stuff a lot. They always use the ""for the children"" excuse to justify authoritarian acts against both kids and adults. In reality this has nothing to do with protecting teens. They're just asserting more control over everyone's internet experience.  And where does it stop? This is one step. But in the future another one will come, and another.

vtubers,n65sxe1,"500 is pretty good! But if you let things get to you and drop it all, you're not going to get anywhere and you lose any goodwill built from the people who did believe in you. Maybe work on yourself first before going for it. If you want to know what you're doing wrong as your original post says, based on what you've responded with here, I think not sticking to one 'face' could be setting you back big time.  You're going to screw up, you're going to look like a fool sometimes, and you may be laughed at or made fun of. If you gain any traction, you may even get detractors and bad actors wanting to derail you, put you in a bad light or figure out what sets you off to crash out. The way you handle all of that is what will make or break you. If you can laugh off your screw ups, lean into your fool moments, laugh along with the people laughing at you, and brush off the detractors and not let them get to you, you will have what it takes to take it to the next level and actually start building a community that will enjoy your company, look up to you and support you through thick and thin. If you stick with it, make them feel good about themselves and your world, people may keep coming back. Don't dump them if things go sideways, work with them and embrace adversity. Don't let yourself be your own worst enemy, and try not to take things too personally.  Something else that can help is watching and observing how other vtubers and streamers do their thing. Learn from the best and try putting some of what they do into action with your own twist and take on things.

(Edit) Also look through her profile. She's not a Vtuber and this post literally has nothing to do with vtubing.

Holostars,n5bkqp6,"Ckia, Moona, Kobo.   Rich Blacksmith, Devastating Moon Artillery, Support/Survival  Cheer Squad/Morale, Lead Base Engineer, Ace Driver.    Ckia! has the wealth and resources, is the Armory, and is adorable enough to inspire the protection instinct giving a buff to “do it for her” in many survival situations. Will have my Close Range Loadout design and created for me (hopefully). I have a feeling she’s got Isekai powers. A must bring. Being a kid she’s a bit prone but also consumes a smaller amount than an adult.   Moona! is Ranged Weapons DPS mage type. Noble with Engineering knowledge and can build megastructures and understands the grind and logistics. Could be part Moon Siren, would be fun to watch her charm enemies to death while singing Hightide. I imagine she’s also got a good negotiation skill and has a level head on her. Anchor of the group.   Kobo! The wonderful Wildcard! With her rain powers, my farm of whatever type should have an easier time being watered, and I should be lacking in potable water. Should we have a poisonous or acid rain, she flips into a Ranged DPS domain debuff for enemies. Either way she could cause a flash storm. Best against a swarm of enemies. Could trigger a flash flood.  Can also clear up crappy weather clouds too.  Comes built in with great banter (but then again my whole lineup is ID so that goes for everyone)  could be part siren as well, but still feels too young to use the power properly, but the vocal projection is strong. Could become a sonic weapon in the right circumstances.  Energy of the group “let me be your sun to shine your day” indeed   May not be as OP as picking from the EN branch, but it’s realistically a group I feel like I could keep up with even the ID girls also still have way more power than me.        The godlike creatures of Myth and Council would be too busy for a mortal like me and would definitely have major main character arcs…. Which comes with a lot of powerful dangers and I am NOT INTERESTED in becoming the cannon fodder/ character turning point by dying in front of them.   Advent and Justice? Still too much Deus-Ex-Machina surrounding them, their shenanigans will get me killed whether as a joke line, running gag, or actually death.    The boys *shudder* I adore them. But running into this much Boyfailure power, combined with my luck…. This group would definitely have me die by accident, and it would never be on purpose.  HQ, Altair is a “secret demon lord” instant MC storyline Im cannon fodder.  Axel is a Gladiator Aussie. Enough said 😂 VANGUARD, again, all members scream MC. I’m sooooo dead.

Holostars,n50dwwi,"Not a shot til some of em blow up in size if we're being realistic. 2 members still need to hit 100k subs, they'd want to all be pulling 1k ccv and maybe 10k for special events before even considering a new gen. I know some members feel more comfortable staying smaller but realistically the majority need to be pulling bigger numbers (which isnt going to be easy, Male vtubers have hit the biggest viewership drop post Covid of all vtuber demos).  What's very concerning, at least to me, is there's way too much overlap, you can visibly see a members ccv drop when another goes live. That's a really not so great sign that the fandom is at its current limit. So fanbase growth is really needed before any more are added. Especially casual fans, none of the EN guys have a shabby core fanbase which is really good (especially money wise) so its more casual fans and branch fans that are especially needed.  I don't think it's necessarily bad to not have any new gens, like I can't speak for JP but the EN lads seem to mention being comfortable staying for a good while into the future which to me seems like internally they're at least breaking even on Stars. I'd much prefer a safer approach of constantly testing smaller projects with Stars and hoping something picks up speed over praying a new gen will save em and splitting the resources even further. They could even go further with experiment imo though i think that's an unpopular opinion.  Like to not be super negative this whole comment, the shorts content has been helping especially sub wise for many of the guys, management is working with what they've got pretty well (Tempus Gala stuff was pretty nice), the members of both branches have been doing more outside collabs (especially those who tended not to). The new twitter account is doing pretty well, the follower count is obviously lower but the interaction rate seems pretty good (reminder to all to interact with it unless you have personal rules on the content you repost on twitter). The boys seem to be doing well generally speaking especially compared to the end of last year.   I know people bring up concerts but I'd just like to see more branch events of any kind first, concerts without paid viewing are a money sink purely done to satisfy current fans and for advertising purposes to new ones but I feel like there's no point advertising either side as a group if they're not doing group stuff at least semi regularly.

Holostars,n2aay55,"For me at least, if one actually enjoys a new, suggested hobby/interest, one would do more off camera simply 'cuz they enjoy it and want to partake/engage.   IMO, a good tell is if they asked less and less questions about game mechanics as the sessions progress 'cuz they're committing these to memory. They start to inherently know what their characters can do because they read up off camera (feats, skills, actions, etc etc).   You can argue that they're busy and juggling multiple projects and obligations, and/or it's too early to judge. And I wouldn't find try to find fault in that. It's valid.   All I'm saying is that their behavior is more aligned with ""I'm having fun with the boys"" and not ""I'm having fun with the boys AND this activity"" similar to how a parent would enjoy engaging with their children's play time -having fun with the company, not necessarily the activity.   I guess VLDL (Viva La Dirt League) encapsulates the point I'm trying to make. They started their early sessions not really getting D&D, one of them arguably didn't even really care and was just doing it ""for the boys and the memes"" so to speak, but they all grew into it as the sessions progressed.

VShojo,n65q5ww,"Now that you mention it, I remember how that all went down now.  For months people were asking for collabs. Henya kept saying she was trying but never heard back, including asking Nazuna's manager and Kson. Nazuna said she pushed away other VShojo members.  I should also add that multiple other members said the same as Henya did. Specifically Zen, Froot, and I think Silver did too. They tried contacting Nazuna and her manager for collabs but never heard back.   But then Nazuna left VShojo, and she tweeted that she was trying to set up a collab a year prior with Henya but never heard back. Someone went to Henya on her stream and mentioned it to her. Henya looked up what Nazuna said and was confused because they weren't even friends on Discord, so she could've never messaged her directly.  Before I didn't know what to think of it, because it's just a really confusing situation. Like they were never able to speak directly to each other, or management never followed through when they tried to pass on a message.  Now it just makes me think of what VShojo told the other talents about Silver and the others who left. Treated them as troublemakers and cut off communication however they could. I'm starting to see a lot of similarities in how both sides said they wanted to talk but never did. How they grew apart because of it like they felt neglected.
